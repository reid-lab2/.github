## Project Overview
The Situational Awareness Tool is a WearOS app designed to help users recognize and manage physiological stress in high-pressure situations.  
Our use cases include:  
- Emergency responders  
- Athletes and coaches  
- Military training  
- Corporate wellness programs

The app helps users monitor their heart rate zones, complete timed sessions, and review session data â€” all focused on building better stress management and decision-making skills.

## Project Goal
We are aiming to deliver a **practical, accessible, and cost-effective** situational awareness training tool prototype.  
It can supplement existing training programs or serve as a standalone resource for individuals and organizations seeking to improve stress response capabilities.
